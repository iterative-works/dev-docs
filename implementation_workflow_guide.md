# Implementation Workflow Guide

This document expands on the implementation phase of our development workflow, focusing on the step-by-step approach for developing features according to our architectural component categories. It provides a structured methodology for incremental, value-driven development.

## Implementation Phase Overview

The implementation phase follows the Feature Planning phase and should be guided by:
1. The approved Feature Specification
2. The Business Value Decomposition
3. The Feature Implementation Plan

This approach ensures we develop features incrementally, focusing on delivering business value while maintaining architectural integrity.

## Component-Driven Development Approach

Our implementation approach follows these key principles:

1. **Value-First Development**: Implement components in order of business value, starting with the Minimum Viable Solution (MVS)
2. **Architecture-Aligned Implementation**: Develop each component according to its architectural classification
3. **Small, Incremental Steps**: Break down development into small, testable increments
4. **Continuous Testing**: Test each component as it is developed
5. **Documented Progress**: Update progress tracking after each component is completed

## Value-Driven Implementation Sequence

Based on the Business Value Decomposition document, the implementation should follow this sequence:

1. **Foundation Components**: Start with technical foundations necessary for any subsequent development
2. **MVS Components**: Implement the components that comprise the Minimum Viable Solution
3. **Value Increment Components**: Add components in order of business value increments
4. **Complete Solution**: Finish remaining components to complete the full solution

## Step-by-Step Implementation Workflow

### 1. Preparation Phase

**Objective**: Set up the development environment and prepare for implementation.

**Steps**:

1. **Initialize Development Environment**:
   - Create feature branch from development branch
   - Set up local development environment
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

2. **Complete the Handoff Protocol**:
   - Verify all required documentation is available and accurate
   - Clarify any ambiguities with Product Owner or Business Analyst
   - Confirm technical approach with Technical Lead

3. **Set Up Progress Tracking**:
   - Initialize Progress Tracking document
   - Map components to implementation tasks
   - Define acceptance criteria for each component

### 2. Component Implementation Process

**Objective**: Implement each component following a consistent approach.

For each component:

1. **Component Planning**:
   - Identify the component's architectural category (Entity, Value Object, Repository, etc.)
   - Review relevant component guides for that category
   - Identify dependencies and required interfaces
   - Define test cases based on acceptance criteria

2. **Interface Development**:
   - Define interfaces before implementations
   - For domain components, start with domain interfaces
   - Document clear contracts and expectations

3. **Test-Driven Development**:
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Start with unit tests for the component
   - Include edge cases and error conditions

4. **Implementation**:
   - Follow the specific guide for the component's architectural category
   - Adhere to coding standards and best practices
   - Focus on the component's single responsibility
   - Avoid premature optimization

5. **Refactoring**:
   - Refactor code for clarity and maintainability
   - Ensure compliance with architectural boundaries
   - Optimize only if necessary and after tests pass

6. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test component integration with dependent components
   - Verify behavior in context of the larger system
   - Test error handling and edge cases

7. **Progress Update**:
   - Update Progress Tracking document
   - Document any deviations from the plan
   - Highlight any risks or issues encountered

### 3. Layer-by-Layer Implementation Approach

To maintain architectural integrity, components should generally be developed in this order:

1. **Domain Layer Components**:
   - Entities
   - Value Objects
   - Aggregates
   - Domain Services
   - Domain Events

2. **Infrastructure Interfaces (Ports)**:
   - Repository Interfaces
   - External System Interfaces
   - Effect Definitions

3. **Application Layer Components**:
   - Commands/Queries
   - Validators
   - Application Services
   - Results

4. **Infrastructure Layer Components**:
   - Repository Implementations
   - Adapters
   - DTOs
   - Infrastructure Services

5. **UI/Presentation Layer Components**:
   - View Models
   - Views
   - Presenters/Services
   - Routes
   - Web Modules

This sequence ensures that core domain logic is built first, followed by the necessary infrastructure to support it, and finally the user interface components that expose the functionality.

### 4. Value Increment Implementation Process

**Objective**: Implement the feature in value-driven increments.

**Steps**:

1. **Implement Foundation Components**:
   - Develop components that are required for technical reasons
   - Follow the component implementation process for each
   - Ensure solid technical foundation before proceeding

2. **Implement MVS Components**:
   - Focus on components required for the Minimum Viable Solution
   - Prioritize by business value within the MVS
   - Complete all MVS components before proceeding to value increments
   - Conduct MVS validation with stakeholders

3. **Implement Value Increment 1**:
   - Develop components for the first value increment
   - Follow the component implementation process for each
   - Update Progress Tracking document
   - Validate with stakeholders

4. **Implement Subsequent Value Increments**:
   - Proceed with Value Increment 2, 3, etc.
   - Validate each increment before proceeding
   - Adjust plans based on feedback and learnings

5. **Complete Solution Implementation**:
   - Develop remaining components
   - Ensure all components work together cohesively
   - Conduct final integration testing

### 5. Integration and Review Process

**Objective**: Ensure all components work together and meet requirements.

**Steps**:

1. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test complete feature end-to-end
   - Verify all acceptance criteria are met
   - Test error handling and edge cases

2. **Code Review**:
   - Submit code for peer review
   - Address review feedback
   - Ensure architectural compliance

3. **Documentation Update**:
   - Update technical documentation
   - Document any technical debt or future improvements
   - Ensure code is well-commented

4. **Stakeholder Review**:
   - Demonstrate completed feature to stakeholders
   - Collect feedback
   - Document any required changes

## Working with AI Agents During Implementation

When using AI agents to assist with implementation, follow these guidelines:

### 1. Clear Component Instructions

- Identify the architectural category of the component
- Provide the relevant component guide
- Share the specific requirements for the component
- Include necessary context from the feature specification

### 2. Incremental AI Collaboration

- Break down tasks into smaller components
- Have AI focus on one component at a time
- Provide feedback on each component before proceeding
- Ensure AI maintains architectural boundaries

### 3. Review and Integration

- Always review AI-generated code before incorporation
- Ensure code follows architectural guidelines
- Test all AI-generated code thoroughly
- Document any deviations or decisions made

### 4. Example AI Prompt Template

```
I need help implementing a [COMPONENT_TYPE] for [FEATURE_NAME].

Feature Context:
[BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FEATURE]

Component Requirements:
[SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COMPONENT]

Dependencies:

- Refactor continuously to maintain code quality

### 2. Maintain Architectural Boundaries

- Respect the separation of concerns between layers
- Keep domain logic in the domain layer
- Avoid infrastructure dependencies in the domain layer
- Don't mix UI concerns with application logic

### 3. Test at Multiple Levels

- Unit test each component thoroughly
- Add integration tests for component interactions
- Include end-to-end tests for complete features
- Test error handling and edge cases

### 4. Document as You Go

- Document key decisions and rationale
- Comment complex logic
- Update technical documentation
- Keep the Progress Tracking document current

### 5. Collaborate Effectively

- Communicate regularly with the team
- Seek feedback early and often
- Pair program for complex components
- Conduct regular code reviews

## Conclusion

This component-driven, value-focused implementation approach ensures that we build features incrementally while maintaining architectural integrity. By following the appropriate component guide for each element we develop, we ensure consistency and quality across our codebase.

After completing the implementation phase according to this workflow, the feature will be ready for the Testing & Review phase, where it will be thoroughly validated before deployment.
