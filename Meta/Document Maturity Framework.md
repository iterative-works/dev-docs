# Document Maturity Framework

This framework defines the maturity levels of documentation in our development workflow vault. It helps team members understand the reliability and completeness of each document.

## Maturity Levels

### ü§ñ AI-Generated
- **Description**: Initial content generated by AI that has not been reviewed by a human.
- **Visual Indicator**: Red callout - "This is AI-generated content pending human review"
- **Frontmatter**: `status: ai-generated`
- **When to Use**: Quick starting point for new documentation needs
- **Limitations**: May contain inaccuracies or misalignments with our actual processes

### üìù Draft
- **Description**: Content that has been human-reviewed but is still a work in progress.
- **Visual Indicator**: Blue callout - "This document is an initial draft and may change significantly"
- **Frontmatter**: `status: draft`
- **When to Use**: Early documentation that captures the main ideas but needs refinement
- **Limitations**: May be incomplete or contain areas that need expansion

### üîç In-Review
- **Description**: Content that is complete enough for thorough peer review.
- **Visual Indicator**: Yellow callout - "This document is under review and feedback is welcome"
- **Frontmatter**: `status: in-review`
- **When to Use**: When you believe the document covers all necessary aspects and want feedback
- **Limitations**: Has not been validated in practical application yet

### ‚úÖ Tested
- **Description**: Documentation that has been successfully applied in at least one real project.
- **Visual Indicator**: Green callout - "This document has been validated in real projects"
- **Frontmatter**: `status: tested`
- **When to Use**: After the document has guided actual work successfully
- **Limitations**: May still need refinements based on broader application

### üåü Stable
- **Description**: Authoritative documentation that has been validated across multiple projects and incorporates feedback.
- **Visual Indicator**: Purple callout - "This document is considered stable and authoritative"
- **Frontmatter**: `status: stable`
- **When to Use**: For documentation that consistently provides correct guidance
- **Limitations**: Still requires periodic review to ensure it remains current

## Progression Process

### Moving from AI-Generated to Draft
- Read through the entire document
- Correct any factual errors
- Ensure the document aligns with our actual practices
- Add missing information for completeness

### Moving from Draft to In-Review
- Complete all sections of the document
- Ensure code examples (if any) are working
- Add diagrams or visual aids where helpful
- Request review from at least one team member

### Moving from In-Review to Tested
- Address all feedback from reviews
- Apply the documented process in at least one real project
- Document any gaps or issues encountered during application
- Update the document based on practical experience

### Moving from Tested to Stable
- Validate the document across multiple different projects
- Obtain confirmation from multiple team members that the content is accurate and useful
- Ensure all edge cases and common scenarios are covered
- Create links to related documents for a comprehensive view

## Review Cycle for Stable Documents

Even stable documents should be reviewed periodically:
- Critical workflow documents: Every 3 months
- Tool-specific documents: After major version updates
- Architecture guidelines: Every 6 months

## Using This System

1. All new documents should include the status in frontmatter
2. Update the status whenever the document progresses to a new level
3. Include the appropriate callout at the beginning of the document
4. When changing status, update the `last_updated` and increment the `version` in frontmatter
