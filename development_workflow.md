# Development Workflow

This document outlines our end-to-end development workflow from change request to feature implementation. It provides a clear process for all team members to follow, ensuring consistent and high-quality delivery.

## Workflow Overview

Our development workflow consists of the following key phases:

1. **Change Request**: Formal documentation of a proposed change
2. **Feature Specification**: Detailed description of the feature to be implemented
3. **Business Value Decomposition**: Analysis to prioritize feature components by business value
4. **Feature Planning**: Technical planning for implementation
5. **Implementation**: Development of the feature
6. **Testing & Review**: Verification that the feature meets requirements
7. **Deployment**: Release of the feature to production

## Detailed Process

### 1. Change Request Phase

**Objective**: Formally document and approve a proposed change.

**Key Template**: [Change Request Template](Templates/change_request_template.md)

**Steps**:

1. **Initiate Change Request**:
   - Stakeholder identifies need for change

**Steps**:

1. **Identify Value Drivers**:
   - Product Owner and stakeholders identify key business value drivers
   - Each value driver is rated for impact and assigned to relevant stakeholders
   - Clear metrics for measuring value are established

2. **Decompose Feature into Components**:
   - Technical and business teams collaborate to break down the feature into components
   - Each component is mapped to value drivers it satisfies
   - Implementation complexity is estimated for each component
   - Value-to-complexity ratio is calculated

3. **Define Value Delivery Sequence**:
   - Define the Minimum Viable Solution (MVS) that delivers meaningful value
   - Identify value increments beyond the MVS
   - Map technical dependencies between components
   - Create phased implementation approach based on value and dependencies

4. **Review and Approve Decomposition**:
   - Stakeholders review the value delivery sequence
   - Technical team validates the implementation approach

### 5. Implementation Phase

**Objective**: Develop the feature according to the Implementation Plan, following the value delivery sequence and component architecture.

**Key Templates**:
- [Handoff Protocol Template](Templates/handoff_protocol_template.md)
- [Progress Tracking Template](Templates/progress_tracking_template.md)
- [Implementation Workflow Guide](implementation_workflow_guide.md)
- Component Development Guides (various guides for each component type)

**Steps**:

1. **Prepare for Development**:
   - Complete the Handoff Protocol checklist
   - Set up Progress Tracking document
   - Create development branch
   - Configure development environment

2. **Implement Foundation Components**:
   - Develop components required for technical reasons first
   - Follow appropriate component guide for each component type
   - Test each component thoroughly
   - Update Progress Tracking document after each component

3. **Implement in Value-Driven Increments**:
   - **Minimum Viable Solution (MVS)**:
     - Develop components required for the MVS
     - Follow component-specific development guides
     - Update Progress Tracking document for each component
     - Validate MVS with stakeholders before proceeding

   - **Value Increment 1**:
     - Develop components for the first value increment
     - Follow layer-by-layer implementation approach:
       1. Domain Layer components first
       2. Application Layer components next
       3. Infrastructure Layer components
       4. UI/Presentation Layer components last
     - Update Progress Tracking document for each component
     - Validate increment with stakeholders

   - **Subsequent Value Increments**:
     - Implement remaining value increments in priority order

4. **Integration and Review**:
   - Ensure all components work together properly
   - Conduct thorough integration testing
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Prepare for Code Review

5. **Code Review**:
   - Submit code for review
   - Address review feedback
   - Ensure architectural compliance
   - Update documentation as needed

**Responsible Roles**:
- Developers
- Technical Lead
- Code Reviewers
- Product Owner (for increment validation)

**Outputs**:
- Implemented feature in code
- Completed test suite
- Updated Progress Tracking document
- Value increments ready for testing

**Component-Driven Development Approach**:

For each component to be implemented:

1. **Component Planning**:
   - Identify the component's architectural category (Entity, Value Object, Repository, etc.)
   - Review relevant component guide for that category
   - Define test cases based on acceptance criteria

2. **Component Development**:
   - Start with interfaces before implementations
   - Write tests before implementation code
   - Follow the specific guide for the component's architectural category
   - Focus on the component's single responsibility

3. **Component Testing**:
   - Test the component thoroughly
   - Verify behavior in isolation and in context
   - Test error handling and edge cases

4. **Progress Update**:
   - Update Progress Tracking document
   - Document any deviations or issues

This component-driven approach ensures each part of the feature is developed according to architectural standards while focusing on incremental business value delivery.

### 6. Testing & Review Phase

## Working with AI Agents

When working with AI agents in the development workflow, special considerations should be applied:

### 1. Clear Instructions

- Provide explicit instructions in task descriptions
- Use templates consistently for all requests to AI agents
- Include all necessary context in the request

### 2. Validation Points

- Always review AI-generated code before incorporation
- Validate outputs against acceptance criteria
- Use the Content Maturity Framework to indicate the status of AI-generated content

### 3. Efficiency Techniques

- Break complex tasks into smaller, well-defined tasks
- Provide examples for similar tasks when available
- Include relevant code patterns and standards in the request

### 4. Integration with Documentation

- Ensure AI agents have access to relevant documentation
- Use feature specifications as input for AI-generated code
- Document any deviations or decisions made during AI-assisted development

### 5. Value-Driven Development with AI

- Provide AI agents with the Business Value Decomposition document
- Clearly indicate which value increment is being implemented
- Ask AI to focus on core value-delivering components first
- Have AI explain how its implementation aligns with business value priorities

### 6. Component-Driven Development with AI

- Provide AI agents with the specific component guide for the type being implemented
- Ask AI to focus on one component at a time
- Have AI explain how it's following the architectural guidelines
- Review AI-generated code for architectural compliance
- Use component-specific prompt templates for consistent results

## Content Maturity Levels

As specified in our [Content Maturity Framework](Content%20Maturity%20Framework.md), all documentation follows these maturity levels:

1. 🤖 **AI-Generated**: Initial raw content from AI
2. 📝 **Draft**: Human-reviewed but still work in progress
3. 🔍 **In-Review**: Complete enough for peer review
4. ✅ **Tested**: Successfully applied in at least one project
5. 🌟 **Stable**: Validated across multiple projects

All workflow documents should include the appropriate status callout and be updated as they mature.

## Workflow Enforcement

To ensure adherence to this workflow:

1. **Automation Checks**:
   - Pull requests require documentation according to templates
   - CI/CD pipeline verifies presence of required documents
   - Status checks ensure documents are at appropriate maturity level

2. **Review Gates**:
   - Change Request approval required before Feature Specification
   - Feature Specification approval required before Business Value Decomposition
   - Business Value Decomposition approval required before Implementation Planning
   - Implementation Plan approval required before development starts

3. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - All code changes must trace back to an approved Change Request
   - All feature implementations must have associated documentation
   - All deployed features must have updated and accurate documentation

4. **Component Compliance Checks**:
   - Pull requests include component category tags
   - Code reviews verify compliance with component-specific guidelines
   - Automated tests check for architectural boundary violations
   - Documentation must reference appropriate component guides
